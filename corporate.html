                "Every year I try and offer my hard working team something different and funny as the main entertainment at our Christmas office party, so I searched the internet for a local Glasgow improv team that could deliver a fantastic one hour show for us. You have no idea how delighted I was after I picked the hilarious Glasgow Improv Theatre; they were all equally engaging, hilarious, quick-witted and hugely entertaining – my team loved them so much I had to invite them back again for this year’s Christmas Office Party.
