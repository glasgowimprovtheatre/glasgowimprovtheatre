                        Couch are a long-form improv team from Glasgow. They are the current house team for Glasgow Harold Night, Improv F*cktown, and Improv Cage Match. Their members have trained at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, and have performed at festivals such as DCM in New York and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. They are going to do a Harold and need a suggestion to get started.
