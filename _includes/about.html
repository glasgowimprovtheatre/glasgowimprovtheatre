                    <p class="text-muted">Our goal is to help nurture the budding improv scene in Glasgow by providing structured training and performance opportunities.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        We focus on American-style long form improv comedy, with a strong emphasis on game-of-the-scene and grounded reality.

                    <p class="text-muted">The theatre will be essentially taking over Improv Glasgow (founded 2016) which has ran the monthly show Glasgow Harold Night as well as drop-in workshops and jams.</p>
