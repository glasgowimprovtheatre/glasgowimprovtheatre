                    <p class="text-muted">
                        We focus on American-style long form improv comedy, with a strong emphasis on game-of-the-scene and grounded reality.

                    <p class="text-muted">The theatre is a continuation of Improv Glasgow, which started in 2016 running the monthly show Glasgow Harold Night as well as drop-in workshops and jams.</p>
