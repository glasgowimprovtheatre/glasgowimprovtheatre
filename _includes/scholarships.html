                        We offer two scholarship places per course. These are spots free of charge for those who are otherwise not able to afford classes.

                        Scholarships are available on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no application process and you wonâ€™t be asked questions about your circumstances or background when requesting one of the scholarship places. Our hope with the scholarship is that we can encourage diversity and remove barriers of entry to learning improv.
                    </p>
