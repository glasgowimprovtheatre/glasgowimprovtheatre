        <h2 class="mt-5">What is an improv jam?</h2>
        <p>An improv jam is akin to a standup open-mic. Anyone is allowed to perform, whether beginner, intermediate, or veteran. You are able to just watch from the audience, if you want to see how they work first. If you want to perform, you will be put into a jam “team” of around 6-8 people, and the team will improvise scenes based off of a word suggestion.</p>
        <p>At all our GIT jams we have experienced improvisers in each team keeping things on the rails, so don't worry!</p>
